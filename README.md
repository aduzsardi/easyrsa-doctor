# easyrsa-doctor

This tool is intended to diagnose an index.txt file generated by easy-rsa (2 and 3).

This file keep the all the information on certificates up to date.

Without arguments, it displays all valid certificates.

You can use this tool to display expired certificates, revoked certificates, or certificates to expire in the next n days.

You can also analyse this file against a PEM formated CRL to find which certificates it revokes, and find missing revoked certificates in the CRL.
